            <h2>Share Drinks</h2>
            <p>At Zola our inspiration and ethos is based on the very simple concept of sharing. When people share
                drink, or indeed anything else,
                it creates a bond. It inspires conversation, interaction and creates an atmosphere that is at once both
                comfortable and sociable.
                We were inspired by Spanish Tapas and the unforgettable feeling of going out with a group of friends and
                passing food across the table.
                Going out for a drink is already an important social standard in England, and we wanted to take that a
                step further and introduce sharing
                into that space to create the perfect social atmosphere for creating memories.</p>

            <h2>Book a Private Booth</h2>
            <p>At Zola, hiring a private booth can ensure a special atmosphere for your social gathering where you
                have a personal and private area in which
                to relax and soak in our ambience. Having a space on which to keep the drinks that are being shared
                between you and your friends can enhance your
                evening with a feeling of safety and security, as well as feeling special and making your evening just
                that little bit more personal. Please feel free
                to telephone with your enquiries, we try to accommodate all requests where possible.</p>
